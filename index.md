## Background
[Quick Look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Look) is among the few features I missed from Mac OS X. It enables *very* quick preview of file by pressing <kbd>Space</kbd> key while highlighting it, without opening its associated application. Then I decide to add this feature to Windows by myself, which results this “QuickLook” project.

You may ask, why you write this when there several alternatives available on the Internet (e.g. [WinQuickLook](https://github.com/shibayan/WinQuickLook) and [Seer](https://github.com/ccseer/Seer))? The answer is that, they are all among those which no longer actively developed, lack of support of file types and plugins, or asking user for amounts of $$$.

## Highlights

 - Tons of supported file types (full list [here](https://github.com/xupefei/QuickLook/wiki/Supported-File-Types))
 - HiDPI support
 - Native 64-bit application
 - Preview from Open and Save File Dialog
 - Preview from 3rd-party file managers (see a list [here](https://github.com/xupefei/QuickLook/wiki/File-Managers))
 - Easy extended by plugins 
 - Strict GPL license to keep it free forever
